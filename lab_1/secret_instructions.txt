Good job!

We're now going to reverse roles. Generate an RSA key pair, 
encrypt the message (described below), and send me the resulting 
private key and ciphertext.

Please send me the a message containing the following information:
1. Your operating system
2. What virtual machines you plan to use
3. Any suggestions for improvements I can make :) (seriously, I eat that shit up)
4. What kinds of security topics are interesting to you. This can be as vague 
or specific as you'd like.
